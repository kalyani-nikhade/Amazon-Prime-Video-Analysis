# Amazon-Prime-Video-Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Amazon Prime Video’s movie and TV catalog, focusing on ratings, popularity, runtime, genres, and content maturity. The goal is to provide a one page view for understanding platform content strategy, user sentiment, and global content distribution using a clean, Prime themed UI inspired by similar public projects and datasets on Amazon Prime content and OTT dashboards.

**Dashboard Highlights**
**KPI Panel:**

Average IMDb score: 5.36

Average TMDb score: 4.72

Average runtime: 85.98 minutes

Average TMDb popularity: 6.53

These KPIs give a quick health check of content quality, length, and engagement on the platform.

**Content Segmentation:**

Top level toggle between Movie and Show to switch analysis by content type.

Genre slicers (action, animation, comedy, crime, documentary, drama, etc.) enable rapid filtering to see how different genres perform on ratings and popularity.

Age certificate slicers (G, PG, PG 13, R, TV 14, TV MA, etc.) show how maturity level is distributed and how it links to scores and runtime.

**Temporal Analysis:**

A bar chart segments titles into New, Mid, and Old based on release year, revealing that “New” content dominates the catalog by volume.

This view helps identify whether the platform is skewed toward recent content or has depth in older titles.

**Score Distribution:**

A histogram of TMDb score ranges visualizes how ratings are spread across titles rather than just showing averages, allowing quick identification of clusters of low, medium, or high rated content.

**Geographical View:**

A world map visual displays production countries, showing how Amazon Prime sources content globally and which regions contribute the most titles.

**Key Insights Derived**

The catalog’s average ratings (IMDb 5.36 / TMDb 4.72) indicate that the bulk of content sits in a mid range quality band rather than being strongly polarized toward hits or flops.

Newer titles form the largest portion of the library, suggesting an aggressive content refresh strategy with emphasis on recent releases over back catalog depth.

Genre and age rating filters reveal that certain genres (e.g., drama, action, comedy) and certificates (TV 14, TV MA) dominate volume, reflecting a focus on mainstream and mature audiences, while family safe categories are comparatively smaller.

The runtime KPI (~86 minutes) signals a catalog optimized around standard feature length viewing, with outliers easily spotted through cross filtering.

Global production mapping highlights the presence of multi regional and multilingual content, important for user growth in non US markets.
